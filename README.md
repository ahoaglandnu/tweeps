### Prerequisites 

`pip install tweepy`

Script is written in Python 3 and also uses Pandas. 

# Documentation

Two go-to references are Tweepy's documentation and the Twitter API

### Tweepy

Highly recommend Tweepy's docs on Code Snippets and their Cursor Tutorial

[Code Snippets](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.0/code_snippet.html) 

[Cursor Tutorial](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.0/cursor_tutorial.html)

### Twitter API

The rate limits can get confusing as different endpoints have different rate limits.
